Add adoption documentation waves 1–3 and MCP registry metadata.

**Wave 1 (R1, R2, R6, R8):** README rewrite with accurate plan/apply semantics and first-success quickstart (WO-01, WO-04); public roadmap and limitations pages (WO-22); provider capability matrix (WO-17).

**Wave 2 (R1):** Local VM and VPS quickstart guide (WO-02); example OpenClaw model/channel configs (WO-03).

**Wave 3 (R3):** MCP safety modes overview and tool risk matrix (WO-07); Claude Code and Cursor client integration guides with read-only/no-destructive setup (WO-08); audit log field reference and redaction guarantees (WO-09).

**MCP registry:** Added `mcpName` field (`io.github.dfridkin/clawops`) to enable listing on the MCP Registry. The MCP server ships in `@clawops/cli` (invoked via `clawops mcp serve`) — no separate package.
